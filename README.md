# A simple but super PyTorch Linear layer CUDA extensen

You need to build before try demo.py

Go to the myLinear\_CUDA\_backend folder to see Detailed Build Instruction.

Research.py is to Debug and Research the Code! 

I'm still working to support CPU inference!

# Research

Go to [The Wiki](https://github.com/UEFI-code/MSRA_thePracticeSpaceProject_PyTorchCUDA/wiki) to see Research Status.

# Todo

## Add beautiful figures to explaining the theory.
## Add Omoshiroii CUDA operator Features.
## Finish the Experiment Report.

# Good news!

You can try to build the CUDA code even you have NO GPU with my HACK!

My Cell Level Forward Available!

My Kaso Cell Backward Available!

Almost done, need a little understand of 'grad\_weights' and Experiment Report.

Go to the myLinear\_CUDA\_backend to See Details.
