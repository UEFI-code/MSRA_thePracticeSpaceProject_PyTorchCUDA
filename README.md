# A simple PyTorch Linear layer CUDA extensen

You need to build before try demo.py

Go to the myLinear\_CUDA\_backend folder to see Detailed Build Instruction.

Research.py is to Debug and Research the Code! 

I'm still working to support CPU inference!

Go to [The Wiki](https://github.com/UEFI-code/MSRA_thePracticeSpaceProject_PyTorchCUDA/wiki) to see Research Status.

# Good news!

You can try to build the CUDA code even you have NO GPU with my HACK!

Go to the myLinear\_CUDA\_backend to See Details.
